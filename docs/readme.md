# Brief
On this brief I will go through the audience, the problem, the solution, my unique value proposition, and pitch. I'll identify the audience and the problem, will come up with a solution using my unique value proposition, and will deliver a pitch.

## Audience
The audience for this particular fast food restaurant would be adults between the ages of 18 – 50 years old, who work all day and don’t have much time to cook, they would not spend more than $50 on a meal and, for most part they would be single or live with a partner, not necessarily married, and have no children. 

## Problem
The problem that this audience have is time. They have a busy lifestyle, not much time to cook or to be hanging on the phone ordering food. They want good, affordable, and fast food.

## Solution
The solution will be a online food ordering system.

## Unique Value Proposition
Build a web application that can handle order and payment online and give the customer a approximate 'ready time', so the customer knows when the food will be ready and can take care of their busy lives while they wait for the food.

## Pitch
We know you are hungry! We'll take care of the food for you.

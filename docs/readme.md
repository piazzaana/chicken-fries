# Brief
The Chicken & Fries customers currently does not have a online ordering system in place. This food ordering app seeks to lower the waiting in line time for their customers by providing a way for the customers to order their food online and have and approximate 'ready' time so they can skip the line.

## Audience
The audience for this particular fast food restaurant would be adults between the ages of 18 – 50 years old, who work all day and don’t have much time to cook, they would not spend more than $50 on a meal and, for most part they would be single or live with a partner, not necessarily married, and have no children. 

## Problem
The problem that this audience have is time. They have a busy lifestyle, not much time to cook or to be hanging on the phone ordering food. They want good, affordable, and fast food.

## Solution
To build an application where the customer can view the available menus and order their food and pay for it online so they can skip the waiting in line time and come back when their food is ready so they can just pick it up and go,

## Unique Value Proposition
Build a web application that can handle order and payment online and give the customer a approximate 'ready time', so the customer knows when the food will be ready and can take care of their busy lives while they wait for the food.
